# multistat_course

The goal of multistat_course is to collect all the assignments and their solution to the multivariate statistics course at ELTE. Most of the solutions are done in a fully reproducible way in R. However, in some instances I use [ROPSTAT](http://www.ropstat.com/) for the calculations.
