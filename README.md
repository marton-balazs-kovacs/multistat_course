# multistat\_course

The goal of multistat\_course is to collect all the assignments and
their solution to the multivariate statistics course at ELTE. Most of
the solutions are done in a fully reproducible way in R. However, in
some instances I use [ROPSTAT](http://www.ropstat.com/) for the
calculations.
